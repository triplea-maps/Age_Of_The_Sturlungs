    this scenario loosely based somewhere around  the year 1226.
    it is in  an early part of a bloody civil war in Iceland.
    In 1218 Snorri Sturluson (chieftain of the vestur-Sturlugar) became a vassal of King Hakon of Norway.
    After Snorri returned  home to Iceland he quickly began, expending his rule of domain and/or trying to bring Iceland under the sovereignty of the king of Norway.
